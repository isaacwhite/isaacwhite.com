There are no special instructions for running the application, simply open index.html in a browser. If you have node installed, http-server is provided in the directory and you can use that as well.

The design is purposely simple. It includes a large text box for inputting user search information, as well as some text to display additional input fields. It requires text to be in the basic input field no matter the other parameters, and provides user feedback in the event that it is empty. General thinking is the main search box should be sufficient for most searches, but if more specificity is desired they can be accessed easily using the additional settings displayed when the user clicks on the link below the box. If 50 results are provided by the api, a button to show the remaining results appears near the bottom which allows the user to continually request addtional texts in chronological reverse order to see all the results.
